# Data-driven analysis of biomedical literature suggests broad-spectrum benefits of culinary herbs and spices

## Abstract
Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as
flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary
preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed
an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on
health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic
investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and
spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining
protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative
effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease
categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also
implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their
therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease
associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic
effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs
with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals
potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.
